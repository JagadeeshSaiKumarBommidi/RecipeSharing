# 🔧 Render Host Blocking Fix

## 🚨 Issue: Host Not Allowed

**Error**: `Blocked request. This host ("recipesharing-3-frontend.onrender.com") is not allowed.`

**Cause**: Your frontend is running as a **Web Service** with `npm start`, but it should be a **Static Site** serving built files.

## ✅ SOLUTION 1: Configure as Static Site (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Delete Current Service
1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Find your current service** (`recipesharing-3-frontend`)
3. **Go to Settings → Delete Service**

### Step 2: Create Static Site (Correct Way)
1. **Create New → Static Site** (NOT Web Service)
2. **Connect your GitHub repository**
3. **Configure exactly like this**:
   ```
   Name: recipe-sharing-frontend
   Branch: main
   Build Command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
   Publish Directory: frontend/dist
   Auto-Deploy: Yes
   ```

## ✅ SOLUTION 2: Quick Fix for Current Service

If you want to keep the current Web Service:

1. **Go to Settings → Environment Variables**
2. **Add these variables**:
   ```
   VITE_HOST=0.0.0.0
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```
3. **Save and Redeploy**

## ✅ SOLUTION 3: Use Updated Vite Config

I've updated `vite.config.ts` to allow Render hosts. Commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render host blocking - add allowedHosts"
git push
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After any of these fixes:
- ✅ **No host blocking errors**
- ✅ **Your React app loads at recipesharing-3-frontend.onrender.com**
- ✅ **Fast static file serving** (if using Static Site)
- ✅ **Global accessibility**

## 💡 Why This Happens

- **Web Services** run `npm start` → uses Vite preview server → host restrictions
- **Static Sites** serve built files directly → no host restrictions → faster

## 🎉 Recommendation

**Use Static Site for frontend** - it's faster, simpler, and designed for React apps!

**Your app will be live and accessible worldwide once properly configured! 🌍🚀**
