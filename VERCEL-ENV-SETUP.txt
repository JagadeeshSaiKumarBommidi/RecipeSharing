🔧 Vercel Environment Variables Setup Guide
============================================

After deploying to Vercel, add these environment variables in your dashboard:

📍 Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these variables:

1. MONGODB_URI
   Value: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/recipesharing
   (Replace with your actual MongoDB connection string)

2. JWT_SECRET  
   Value: your-super-secret-jwt-key-12345
   (Use a long, random, secure string)

3. CLIENT_URL
   Value: https://your-app-name.vercel.app
   (Replace with your actual Vercel URL after deployment)

4. NODE_ENV
   Value: production

🔄 After adding variables:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click the three dots (⋯) on latest deployment  
- Click "Redeploy"
- Wait for redeployment to complete

✅ Your app will then be fully functional with:
